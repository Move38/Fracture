/*  Fracture (Game)
 *  
 *  Setup: For 3-6 players. Each player gets 5-6 tiles of a specific color.
 *         Game starts will all tiles connected, but completely segregated by color.
 *
 *  Goal: Get your tiles to be touching only other players tiles.
 *        Your tiles must be touching at least two other tiles to feel happily diverse.
 *
 *  Turns: Start from a player of choice and then go clockwise taking turns.
 *         A turn consists of fracturing the population into two sub populations,
 *         and then connecting them back together in any way you please.
 *  
 *  When a player has a tile fully diversified, it will blink in unison with other blinking Blinks of its color,
 *  first player to have all of their tiles blink wins.
