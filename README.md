Fracture is a strategic multiplayer game promoting healthier communities. As an urban planner, use your spatial reasoning skills to create a diverse habitat for your community. 

## SETUP
At the start of the game, each player begins with the same number of tiles (4 or more). Each player selects a different color and forms a group with their tiles. All players then combine their groups so they are all touching one another in a cluster (see Fig. 1).

## GAMEPLAY
On their turn, a player makes a fracture* by splitting and separating the cluster into two smaller clusters, and then reconnect them in any way they choose. The two smaller clusters can be of any size; they do not have to be equal. You can choose to only move a single tile if you wish, and you can move any tile, not just the ones of your own color.

Once a player has finished their move, turns proceed in a clockwise fashion. The game ends when a player has completely diversified each tile from their group, and they are all ‘blinking’ in happiness.

*Fractures must be able to be slid into and out of place while remaining on the table.

## WIN CONDITION
The first player to get each of their tiles to:

a) touch at least two other tiles, AND

b) not be touching a tile of its own color group.

When a tile satisfies both these conditions, it will animate ‘blinking’ continuously in happiness. In any other case, it will simply display its color and remain static.

The first player to make all tiles of their color group happy in a single move wins.
