| Number of Blinks | Number of Players | Duration of Gameplay | Recommended Ages |
|------------------|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| 12+               | 3 (or more)      |  10 - 30 minutes     | 12 & Up          |

## Objective
A population divided. Your goal is to make your Blinks connected to the community and surrounded by diversity. (touch at least 2 other Blinks and none of your own color). It's a competitive game towards diversity.

Want to play a cooperative version, it's for advanced players, and quite the collaborative puzzle!

## Setup
Arrange the Blinks so that each color is segregated. Make the board as radially symmetric as possible (this works perfectly for games with 2, 3, or 6 players, and you can get creative for games with 4 or 5 players.
